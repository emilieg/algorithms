#Linked-Lists

##About
- collection of nodes (data + next point)
- connected thru links but not consecutive
- can grow dynamically unlike arrays
- **Singly Linked List** => can only go forward
- **Doubly Linked List** => is circular and allows to go back and forward

##When to use
- when you want to be able to insert items in the middle of the list (in an array you have to move/reassign the indexes for the 'tail'/rest of the data)
- when you don't know the size of your data

##Methods in JavaScript
- **head**, **current.next**
